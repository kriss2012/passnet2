# 🔐 PassNet: AI-Powered Password Strength Checker

> A Deep Learning application that uses an LSTM Neural Network to analyze password strength based on patterns found in real-world data leaks.

![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-Web%20App-lightgrey)

## 📖 Overview

Unlike traditional password checkers that only look for length or special characters, **PassNet** uses a trained **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. It has "learned" the patterns of weak passwords by training on the famous **RockYou** dataset.

It analyzes character sequences to detect subtle weaknesses and provides real-time feedback via a web interface.

## ✨ Features

* **Deep Learning Model:** Uses NLP techniques (Tokenization + Embedding + LSTM) to understand password structure.
* **Real-time Analysis:** Asynchronous (AJAX) requests provide instant feedback without reloading the page.
* **Data-Driven:** Trained on a subset of the massive `rockyou.txt` leak database.
* **Visual Feedback:** Dynamic strength meter and color-coded advice.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Deployment:** Gunicorn (Ready for Render/Heroku)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/passnet.git](https://github.com/yourusername/passnet.git)
cd passnet

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Download the Dataset

**Note:** This project requires the `rockyou.txt` dataset.

1. Download it from [Kaggle](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyou).
2. Extract the file.
3. Place `rockyou.txt` in the root folder of this project.

## 🧠 Training the Model

You must train the AI before running the app. Run these scripts in order:

**Step 1: Process the Data**
Reads the massive text file and creates a balanced dataset of strong/weak passwords.

```bash
python preprocess.py

```

**Step 2: Train the Neural Network**
Feeds the data into the LSTM model. This creates `passnet_model.h5`.

```bash
python train.py

```

## 🌐 Running the Application

Once the model is trained, start the web server:

```bash
python app.py

```

Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## ☁️ Deployment

This project includes a `Procfile` for easy deployment on platforms like **Render**.

1. Push your code to GitHub (ensure `passnet_model.h5` and `tokenizer.pickle` are uploaded if you aren't training in the cloud).
2. **Important:** Do NOT upload `rockyou.txt` or `training_data.csv` to GitHub (add them to `.gitignore`).
3. Connect your repo to Render/Heroku and use the start command: `gunicorn app:app`.

## 📜 License

This project is open-source and available for educational purposes.

```

### 💡 One Last Tip for You:
To make your GitHub repository look professional, you should create a file named `.gitignore` in your folder and add the following lines to it. This prevents you from accidentally uploading the massive text file or junk files to GitHub:

**File name: `.gitignore`**
```text
__pycache__/
*.pyc
rockyou.txt
training_data.csv
venv/
.env

```

Would you like me to explain how to add a "Screenshot" section to the README once you have the app running?
